# Cracked Concrete Classifier (ResNet + PyTorch)

This project is a deep learning-based image classifier designed to detect **cracks in concrete**. It uses a ResNet architecture and an open-source dataset to achieve **highly accurate binary classification** between cracked and uncracked concrete surfaces.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ End-to-end training and evaluation pipeline
- 🧠 Deep learning model using ResNet architecture (PyTorch)
- 📊 Achieved **99% validation accuracy** with high precision and recall
- 🧪 Automated evaluation with classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## 📈 Results

- ✔️ **Validation Accuracy:** 99%  
- ✔️ **Precision & Recall:** High scores on both classes  
- ✔️ Reliable classifier for concrete surface inspection tasks

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- 📦 Fine-tune the model for real-time deployment (e.g., on-site inspections)
- 🌐 Build a web interface for image uploads and on-the-fly predictions
- 🔍 Integrate region-based detection for localizing crack positions
